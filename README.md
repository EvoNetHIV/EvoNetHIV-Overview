EvonetHIV is a stochastic agent-based simulation model that incorporates sexual network structure, behavior, HIV evolution, and treatment. Each simulation first estimates a statistical model that governs sexual network structure, and then proceeds through a burn-in period and epidemic simulation. At each time step of both the burn-in period and epidemic simulation, (1) partnerships form and dissolve; (2) sexual acts take place within a subset of existing partnerships; (3) HIV transmission occurs probabilistically within a subset of sexual acts; (4) viral dynamics and disease progression are updated for each infected agent; (5) vital dynamics, such as aging, are updated, and (6) testing and treatment are implemented at user-specified intervals.
