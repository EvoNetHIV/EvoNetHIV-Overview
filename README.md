EvonetHIV is a stochastic agent-based simuln model that incorporates sexual network structure, behavior, HIV evolution, and treatment. Each simulation first estimates a statistical model that governs sexual network structure, and then proceeds through a burn-in period and epidemic simulation. At each time step of both the burn-in period and epidemic simulation, (1) partnerships form and dissolve; (2) sexual acts take place within a subset of existing partnerships; (3) HIV transmission occurs probabilistically within a subset of sexual acts; (4) viral dynamics and disease progression are updated for each infected agent; (5) vital dynamics, such as aging, are updated, and (6) testing and treatment are implemented at user-specified intervals.

## Viral Load progression overview
At infection, agent's viral load (VL) begins at initial VL value of 1e-4. The following acute phase last 90 days and has an exponential increase to the peak of the acute phase and then a bi-phasic decline to the SPVL value. After the acute phase, the chronic phase begins with viral load at the SPVL and progresses with a slight increase in VL. At the beginning of the AIDS phase (triggered when CD4 counts fall &lt;200), a linear increase to the assumed maximum VL value in AIDS (6.38 log10) starts.

Below are two examples of VL progression. The top figure shows a progression for an agent that has a low SPVL. This results in the chronic phase starting at the low SPVL a noticeable increase in VL occurs at the beginning of the AIDS stage. The bottom figure shows a VL progression for a high SPVL, which results in a shorter chronic phase and faster time to AIDS and earlier death.
