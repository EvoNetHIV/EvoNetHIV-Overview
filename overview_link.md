## Viral Load progression overview
At infection, agent's viral load (VL) begins at initial VL value of 1e-4. The following acute phase last 90 days and has an exponential increase to the peak of the acute phase and then a bi-phasic decline to the SPVL value. After the acute phase, the chronic phase begins with viral load at the SPVL and progresses with a slight increase in VL. At the beginning of the AIDS phase (triggered when CD4 counts fall &lt;200), a linear increase to the assumed maximum VL value in AIDS (6.38 log10) starts.

The figure below shows a progression for an agent that has a low SPVL. This results in the chronic phase starting at the low SPVL and a noticeable increase in VL occurs at the beginning of the AIDS stage.
